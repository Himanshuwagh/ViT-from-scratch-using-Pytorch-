### PyTorch Paper Replicating

In this project, we're going to be replicating a machine learning research paper and creating a Vision Transformer (ViT) from scratch using PyTorch.

We'll then see how ViT, a state-of-the-art computer vision architecture, performs on our Sports Classification Mini problem.
